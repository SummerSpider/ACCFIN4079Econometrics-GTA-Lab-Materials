## Lab 2 – Sequences, Distributions, and Univariate Regression
This lab introduces tools for data generation and statistical modeling. You will 
- learn how to create numeric and date sequences efficiently
- learn to simulate random data
- work with key probability distributions (Normal, Student’s t, and Fisher)
- The lab also covers univariate regression analysis, including estimation, hypothesis testing, and economic interpretation, providing a bridge between statistical theory and applied financial analysis.
