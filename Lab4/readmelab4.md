## Lab 4 – Regression Diagnostics and Model Validation
This lab focuses on checking the assumptions of the classical linear regression model. You will 
- learn how to test for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, non-normality, and model misspecification using standard econometric tests.
- understand why diagnostic testing is essential for reliable inference and empirical research.
